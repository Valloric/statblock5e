  <!--   You do NOT need to set data-content-height to get two columns! You only
       need to have the data-two-column attribute present. With only that
       attribute, text will be flowed across the two columns until they are
       "balanced." Start with that.
         If that produces unpleasent results, you can use data-content-height to
       force the column heights to your liking. This will result in the first
       column always being completely full and the second possibly having
       whitespace at the bottom.
         Be careful about setting a height that's too low! That will produce all
       sorts of weird results. -->
